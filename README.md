# ejira

## Purpose

**Warning** This code is highly in beta, and isn't anywhere near public use.  It's currently undergoing active development.

This project is intended to allow for emacs <-> jira communication in some simple cases.  As an avid user of Emacs and org-mode
for work.  The issue arises, for me, is that I rather dislike using Jira (and confluence), but still need to collaborate.

This library will never really be a full fledged client for emacs/org-mode, jira, or confluence.  That said, it will utilize
existing libraries where possible, and can be a good demonstration of how I'm approaching it.  Over time, this project may 
grow to be a more general purpose library, but as now, it's direction is fairly specific.
